##### OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT


#### PROJECT :  ****Create a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations****

#### OBJECTIVE
***The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple vulnerability scanning tool that can***:
1.Identify Open Ports: Scan a target network or website to find open ports that may be susceptible to attacks.
2.Detect Outdated Software Versions: Check for known vulnerabilities in software versions running on the target system.
3.Identify Misconfigurations: Look for common misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.



### KEY COMPONENTS
1. ***Port Scanning***:
Use techniques such as TCP SYN scan to identify open ports on a target.
Implement a timeout mechanism to avoid long wait times.
2. ***Version Detection***:
Retrieve software version information from services running on open ports.
Use a database of known vulnerabilities (like the National Vulnerability Database) to match versions against known issues.
3. ***Configuration Checks***:
Perform basic checks for common misconfigurations (e.g., default credentials, unnecessary services running).
  

#### TECHNOLOGY USED
*Python*: For implementing the core algorithms and logic.
