OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT : Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Implement algorithms to analyze factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to provide feedback on password strength.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to develop a software tool that evaluates the strength of passwords entered by users. The tool should implement algorithms to analyze key factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness.

KEY ACTIVITIES
Certainly! Here are the main four key activities:

Algorithm Development

Develop algorithms to assess password strength based on length, complexity, and uniqueness.
Implementation

Build the tool's core functionality using a suitable programming language and integrate the analysis algorithms.
Testing and Validation

Conduct thorough testing of the tool to ensure accuracy and reliability, including unit, integration, and user testing.
User Interface Design

Create a user-friendly interface for password input and feedback display, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
TECHNOLOGY USED
Python: For implementing the core algorithms and logic.
